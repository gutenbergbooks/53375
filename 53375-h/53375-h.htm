aglow by its songs and the writings of its poets, I have been inspired

legends and their traditions may linger and be transmitted to the

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Robert Frank Jarrett was born in Asheville, N. C.,
on July 21st, 1864, and while having resided in other states and cities
and visited many of the most important sections of the South, yet has
made his principal home within the shadows of the rugged mountain peaks
of his native and picturesque home land, the Old North State.</p>
<p class="par">He was educated in the field and forest, by rippling
stream and rolling rill, studied in the open book of Nature and recited
to the Master of Destinies where the shadows of the everlasting hills
lock hands with the sunshine of the valley.</p>
<p class="par">He is a reader and student of the ancient writers and
poets of all ages, singer of the old songs, lover of the new;</p>
<p class="par">Servant in official capacity for many years of National,
State and Civic governments; humble worker with the busy toilers, and
writer of prose and verse from earliest childhood;</p>
<p class="par">Author of &ldquo;Back Home and Other Poems,&rdquo;
published in 1911, and many other manuscripts not yet published.</p>
<p class="par">Married to Sallie C. Wild, of Franklin, N. C., on Dec.
25th, 1892. For twenty years a resident of Dillsboro, N. C., where

<h2 class="main">THE CHEROKEE.</h2>
<h2 class="sub"><i>A brief history of the Cherokee Nation or
tribe.</i></h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This history has been gleaned from the works of
Ethnology by James Mooney and from word of mouth, as related to the
author during the past thirty years.</p>
<p class="par">In the beginning of historical events, we hear of man in
his paradisaical home, located somewhere within the boundaries known as
ancient Egypt or Chaldea. His home was far away and his former history
shrouded in the darkness of countless centuries of the past, and when
we contemplate the remoteness of his ancestry, we become lost in the
midst of our own research.</p>
<p class="par">When historical light began to flash from the Orient, we
find man emerging with some degree of civilization from a barbaric
state into the advanced degrees of civilized and enlightened
tribes.</p>
<p class="par">When the maritime navigator, full of visions and dreams,
dared to sail for those hitherto undiscovered shores, now known as
America, there lived within the realm a wandering, happy, yet
untutored, race of men whom we afterwards called Indians, who dwelt in
great numbers along the whole distance from Penobscot Bay south to the
everglades of Florida.</p>
<p class="par"></p>
<div class="figure xd23e532width" id="p009"><img src="images/p009.jpg"

<p class="figureHead">Tuckaseigee Falls, above Dillsboro, N. C.</p>
<p class="par first"></p>
<div class="q">
<div class="body">
<div class="lgouter">
<p class="line">&ldquo;All along the racing river</p>
<p class="line">Gorgeous forest trees are seen.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">Among the more noted tribes were the Abnaki, Mohawk,
Mohican, Huron, Iroquois, Munsi, Erie, Seneca, Susquehanna, Mamrahoac,
Powhatan, Monacan, Nollaway, Tuscarora, Pamlico, Catawba, Santee,
Uchee, Yamasee, Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, Showano and Cherokee, but of
all of these it is left for us to speak alone of the valiant Cherokee,
the most noble of all Red <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>Men, who inhabited that picturesque
country in the Appalachian chain of mountains in East Tennessee,
Western North Carolina, Northern Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama,
and part of Virginia, Kentucky and West Virginia.</p>
<p class="par">These are the people of whom little has been said and
less written than most of the children of men. Yet of all of the native
Americans the Cherokee tribe was the most noble, humane and
intelligent.</p>
<p class="par">Somewhere in the annals of the Aborigines of America,
the Cherokee separated from the great Northern tribe, the Iroquois, and
by preference inhabited the hills of the Appalachian range, and here we
find them early in the dawn of American history, occupying a country
which affords ample environment for the artist, the poet and the
painter. Had Homer seen and Michelangelo traveled among the towering
hills of the happiest land of earth, the song and the chisel, instead
of being draped with the vail of blood, would have inspired the world
to look forward to the time when there will be no death serenely
sitting upon the throne of war.</p>
<p class="par">At one time the Cherokee tribe was the largest and most
learned in art and literature of any tribe in the United States, having
perhaps as many as twenty-five thousand people, and attained, under
Sequoya, whose photograph is herein reproduced, that degree of
learning, that many of the tribe became quite familiar with letters and
literature, printed from the alphabet invented by this noted man,
inventor and devout preacher of the Christian gospel.</p>
<p class="par">Sequoya was himself an untutored half-breed, yet to him
are we indebted for an alphabet of 76 characters which stands third
among the alphabets which have been invented among men, and by which a
Cherokee child <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>learns to read as fluently in six months of study
as does the average English child in three years of study under our
system.</p>
<p class="par">The name Cherokee, so far as research reveals, has no
meaning or the meaning has been lost or perhaps Anglicized, but we have
authority for its use, for the past 375 years.</p>
<p class="par">When De Soto&rsquo;s expedition was made through the
Appalachian mountains, in 1540, he encountered this great and friendly
nation living peacefully in their paradise among the hills and
mountains, who received him as they were wont to receive a friendly
tribe; so did they ever receive and treat the white neighbor until
treaty after treaty had been broken and their homes had been destroyed
and every compact violated.</p>
<p class="par">Hostilities were in most cases caused by encroaching
whites and broken promises and intrigues of the foreigners, who were
gradually drawing the cordon around the diminishing tribe.</p>
<p class="par">The battle of Horseshoe Bend, which took place in the
Tallapoosa river, in Alabama, on the 27th day of March, 1814, was one
of the notable events in Cherokee history, where Junaluska, in
conjunction with General Jackson, slaughtered or massacred nearly one
thousand Creeks, which ended the Creek war and brought much honor to
Junaluska and his valiant Cherokee army of more than 500 men.</p>
<p class="par">For the terrors which followed the battle of Horseshoe
Bend, we have only to refer to history to be able to ascertain the
facts concerning the bloody atrocities which were perpetrated upon an
oppressed people. Then came the end, which occurred in the year 1838,
which culminated in the removal of the band to the Indian Territory,
which is now called Oklahoma, (a Choctaw word meaning red people, Okla,
people; homa, red). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12"
name="pb12">12</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">This removal was the most luckless and recreant of all
the abuses that had been heaped upon the brave but helpless band of
Cherokee.</p>
<p class="par">Junaluska, who witnessed the removal, but was permitted
to remain with the residue, remarked that had he known that General
Jackson (who became President), would have removed the Cherokee in such
a brutal manner, he would have killed him at the battle of Horseshoe
Bend.</p>
<p class="par">The history of the removal of the Cherokee, as told by
James Mooney of the Department of American Ethnology, gleaned by him
from eye witnesses and actors in the tragedy, may well exceed in weight
of grief and pathos any other act in American history. Even the much
sung song of the exile of the Arcadians falls far behind it in the sum
of death and misery.</p>
<p class="par">Under General Winfield Scott, an army of 5,000
volunteers and regular troops were concentrated in the Cherokee
country, and by instruction from Washington, D. C., he was directed and
gave orders to soldiers to gather all Indians to the various stockades,
which had been previously prepared for their reception. From these
posts, squads of soldiers were sent to search out, with rifle and
bayonet, every small cabin which could be found within the
ramifications and deep recesses of the great Appalachian range of
mountains, and bring to the forts every man, woman and child to be
found within the gates of the granite hills.</p>
<p class="par">Families, while sitting peacefully at the noon-day meal;
others while performing the matutinal ablution, were suddenly startled
by the gleam of bayonets and with blows, curses and oaths from the men
called soldiers, the Indians were driven like cattle from their humble
homes down the rugged mountain paths, and their houses in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>many
cases were burned and their small possessions destroyed, as the brave
but defenceless Cherokee people looked on with that wonderful stoicism
which no other race of men ever possessed.</p>
<p class="par">Men were seized in the fields, women torn from the wheel
and the distaff, and children frightened from the pleasures of play.
The vandals who followed in the wake of the soldiery, looting and
pillaging, burning and destroying, yet calling themselves civilized
Christians, were such a band of outlaws as is seldom seen even among
the most savage and barbaric races.</p>
<p class="par">Even Indian graves were robbed of the silver pendants
and other valuables which had been deposited with the dead. Women who
were not able to go, were actually forced at the point of a bayonet to
march with the same speed as men.</p>
<p class="par">Upon one occasion the soldiers surrounded the house of
an old Christian patriot, who when informed as to what was to take
place, called his wife, children and grandchildren around him, kneeling
down among them offered a last prayer in the sanctuary of his home, in
his native tongue, while the soldiers stood astonished, looking on in
silence.</p>
<p class="par">When his devotions were finished, he arose, bade the
household follow him, and he led them into exile, with that becoming
Christian fortitude which is seldom witnessed among men.</p>
<p class="par">One woman, on finding the house surrounded, went to the
door and called up the chickens, fed them for the last time, bade them
farewell, then taking her baby upon her back, she extended her hands to
her other two small children, then followed her husband into exile,
from whence she never returned.</p>
<p class="par">A Georgia volunteer, who afterwards became a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>Colonel in the Confederate service, said, &ldquo;I
have fought through the Civil War and have seen men shot to pieces and
slaughtered by the thousands, but the Cherokee removal was the most
cruel work I ever witnessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">All were not thus so submissive. One old man named
Tsali, &ldquo;Charlie,&rdquo; was seized, with his wife, his brother,
his three sons and their families; exasperated at the brutality
accorded his wife, who being unable to travel fast, was prodded with
the bayonets to hasten her steps, he urged the other men to join him in
a dash for liberty, and as he spoke in Cherokee, the soldiers, although
they heard, understood nothing until each warrior suddenly sprang upon
the soldier nearest and endeavored to wrench his gun from him. The
attack was so sudden and unexpected that one soldier was killed and the
rest fled, while the Indians escaped to the mountains. Hundreds of
others, some of them from the various stockades, managed also to escape
to the hills and mountains from time to time, where those who did not
die from starvation subsisted on roots and wild berries until the hunt
was over.</p>
<p class="par">Finding that it was impossible to secure these
fugitives, General Scott finally tendered them a proposition, through
Colonel W. H. Thomas, known as Wil-Usdi in Cherokee, their trusted
friend and chief, that if they would bring Charlie and his party for
punishment, the rest would be allowed to remain until their case could
be adjusted by the Government.</p>
<p class="par">On hearing of the proposition, Charlie voluntarily came
in with his sons, offering himself as a sacrifice for his people.</p>
<p class="par">By command of General Scott, Charlie, his brother and
the two elder sons were shot, near the mouth of Tuckaseigee river, a
detachment of Cherokee prisoners <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15"
href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>being compelled to do the
shooting in order to impress upon the Indians the fact of their utter
helplessness.</p>
<p class="par">From those fugitives thus permitted to remain,
originated the present eastern band of Cherokee.</p>
<p class="par">When nearly 17,000 Cherokee had been gathered into the
stockades, the removal began.</p>
<p class="par">Early in June several parties, aggregating about five
thousand persons, were brought down by the troops to the old agency on
Hiwassee river, at the present Calhoun, Tenn., and to Ross landing (now
Chattanooga, Tenn.) and to Gunter&rsquo;s landing (now Guntersville,
Ala.) lower down on the Tennessee, where they were put upon steamers
and transported down the Tennessee and Ohio to the farther side of the
Mississippi, whence their journey was continued by land to Indian
Territory (now Oklahoma).</p>
<p class="par">The removal in the the hottest part of the year was
attended with so great sickness and mortality that, by resolution of
the Cherokee National Council, John Ross and the other chiefs submitted
to General Scott a proposition that the Cherokee be allowed to remove
themselves in the fall, after the sickly season ended. This was granted
on condition that all should have started by the 20th of October,
except the sick and aged, who might not be able to move so rapidly.
Accordingly, officers were appointed by the Cherokee council to take
charge of the emigration; the Indians being organized into detachments
averaging one thousand each, with two leaders in charge of each
department, and a sufficient number of wagons and horses for the
purpose.</p>
<p class="par">In this way the remainder, enrolled at about 13,000,
(including a few negro slaves), started on the long march overland late
in the fall. Those who thus emigrated under the management of their own
officers, assembled <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>at Rattlesnake Springs, near the present
Charleston, Tenn., where a final council was held, in which it was
decided to continue their old constitution and laws in their new home.
Then, in October, 1838, the long procession of exiles was set in
motion. A few went by the river route, but nearly all went overland.
Crossing, to the north side of the Hiwassee river, at a ferry above
Gunter&rsquo;s Creek, they proceeded down along the river, the sick,
aged and children, together with their belongings, being hauled in
wagons, the rest on foot or on horses.</p>
<p class="par">It was like an army, 645 wagons, regiment after
regiment, the wagons in the center, the officers along the line, and
the horsemen on the flank and at the rear.</p>
<p class="par">Tennessee river was crossed at Tucker&rsquo;s ferry, a
short distance above Jolly&rsquo;s Island, at the mouth of Hiwassee;
thence the route lay south of Pikeville, through McMinnville, and on to
Nashville, where the Cumberland was crossed.</p>
<p class="par">They then went on to Hopkinsville, where the noted chief
White Path, in charge of a detachment, sickened and died. His people
buried him by the roadside, with a box over the grave and poles with
streamers around it, that the others coming on behind might note the
spot and remember him.</p>
<p class="par">Somewhere along that march of death&mdash;for the exiles
died by tens and twenties every day of the journey&mdash;the devoted
wife of the noted chief, John Ross, sank down and died, leaving him to
go on with bitter pain of bereavement added to the heartbreak at the
ruin and desolation of his nation.</p>
<p class="par">The Ohio was crossed at a ferry near the mouth of the
Cumberland, and the army passed on through southern Illinois until the
great Mississippi was reached, opposite <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>Cape Girardean, Missouri.
It was now the middle of winter, with the river running full of ice, so
that several detachments were obliged to wait some time on the eastern
bank for the channel to become clear.</p>
<p class="par">Information furnished by old men at Tahlequah after the
lapse of fifty years showed that time had not sufficed to wipe out the
memory of the miseries of that halt beside the frozen river, with
hundreds of sick and dying penned up in wagons or stretched upon the
ground, with only a blanket overhead to keep out the January blast.</p>
<p class="par">The crossing was at last made, in two divisions, at Cape
Girardean and Green&rsquo;s ferry, a short distance below, whence the
march was continued on through Missouri to Indian Territory, the later
detachment making a northerly circuit by Springfield, because those who
had gone before had killed off all the game along the direct route.</p>
<p class="par">They had started in October, 1838, and it was now March,
1839, the journey having occupied nearly six months of the hardest part
of the year.</p>
<p class="par">It is difficult to state positively as to the mortality
and loss by reason of the removal of this once happy nation, but as
near as can be ascertained, more than four thousand persons perished
along the great highway of death.</p>
<p class="par">On the arrival in Indian Territory, the exiles at once
set about building houses and planting crops, the government having
agreed under treaty to furnish them rations for one year after arrival.
They were welcomed by their kindred, the &ldquo;Old Settlers,&rdquo;
who held the country under previous treaties of 1828 and 1833. These,
however, being already regularly organized under a government and
chiefs of their own, were by no means disposed to be swallowed by the
governmental authority of the newcomers. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Jealousies developed, in which the minority or treaty
party of the emigrants, headed by Major Ridge, took sides with the old
settlers against John Ross of the National party, which outnumbered the
others nearly three to one.</p>
<p class="par">While these differences were at their height, the Nation
was thrown into a fever of excitement by the news that Major Ridge, his
son, John Ridge, and Elias Boudinot&mdash;all leaders of the treaty
party&mdash;had been killed by adherents of the National party,
immediately after the adjournment of a general council, which had
adjourned after nearly two weeks of debate without having been able to
bring about harmonious action. Major Ridge was waylaid and shot near
the Arkansas line, his son was taken from bed and cut to pieces with
hatchets, while Boudinot was treacherously killed at his home at Park
Hill, Indian Territory, all three being killed upon the same day, June
22, 1839, which date marks the decline and fall of a once great and
happy people. For fifty years which followed this luckless day in June,
Indian Territory became a veritable theater of crime and disorder.</p>
<p class="par">From the South meridian of the sunflower state, to the
cypress banks of the Red river, and from Fort Smith to the shifting
sands of the great plains, for half a century sheltered a coterie of
actors that would have made Robin Hood or Kit Carson blush with envy.
The soil of the five tribes has been moistened with human blood when
there was none to answer the cry for vengeance; when no sound save the
deadly snap of the Winchester and the pit-pat of the bronchos' hoofs
were there to bear testimony. Now, those who incited intrigue and
murder are gone, the desperado is a thing of the past, the brave men
who enlisted in the hazardous governmental service <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>to give
them battle have disappeared, and the sound of the firing Winchester
used in deadly conflict, has been replaced by the reaper and the mower,
and toilers in the field of commerce and industry.</p>
<p class="par">The Indian tribe has been supplanted by the American
Government; and the school and church have taken the place of the chase
and the feud. Where the wild flowers nodded far out on the lonely
plain, vast fields of wheat and corn whisper the great name of
Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="par">At this writing the eastern band of Cherokee is about to
be dissolved, their lands allotted, and in a few more decades the
Cherokee will have passed, and the name will be presented only in old
records and in the hearts of their descendants. <span class=

<p class="par">Next in rank of importance comes Itagunahi, better known
among the English-speaking people as John Axe, who was born in the year
1800, saw the battle of Horseshoe Bend, witnessed the removal of the
Cherokee tribe in 1838. He knew its history and almost all of the
myths, legends and stories, transmitted many of them to the white man
for record, and while he never spoke English, he was a very versatile
and interesting man of the old type of Indians, and strong to the last
days; he lived to near 100 years, then passed to the Happy Hunting
Grounds.</p>
<p class="par">To John D. Wofford, of the Western Reservation or tribe,
we are indebted for much information, which would have been lost except
for his wonderful knowledge.</p>
<p class="par">All the story-tellers prefaced their remarks by saying,
&ldquo;This is what the old folks used to tell us when we were
boys.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Cherokee myths may be classified as sacred myths, animal
stories, local legends, and historical traditions. The sacred myths
were not for every one, but only those might hear who observed the
proper form and ceremony.</p>
<p class="par">In the old times the myth-keepers and priests were
accustomed to meet together at night in the asi, or low-built log
sleeping house, to recite the traditions and discuss their secret
knowledge. At times those who desired instruction from an adept in the
sacred lore of the tribe would meet the priest by appointment in the
asi, where they sat up all night talking, with only the light of a
small fire burning in the middle of the floor. At daybreak the whole
party went down to the running stream, where the pupils or hearers of
the myths stripped themselves and were scratched upon the naked skin
with a bone tooth comb in the hands of the priest, after which they
waded out, facing the rising sun, and dipped seven times under the
water, while the priest recited prayers upon the bank. The purificatory
rite, which was observed more than a century ago by Adair, is also a
part of the ceremonial of the ball play, the green-corn dance, and, in
fact, every important ritual performance. Before beginning one of the
stories of the sacred class the informant would sometimes suggest
jokingly that the author first submit to being scratched and, &ldquo;Go
to water.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131"

<h3 class="label">MYTH ONE.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>How the World Was Made.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The earth is a great island floating in a sea of
water, and suspended at each of the four cardinal points by a cord
hanging down from the sky vault, which is of solid rock. When the world
grows old and worn out, the people will die and the cords will break,
and let the earth sink down into the ocean, and all will be water
again. The Indians are afraid of this.</p>
<p class="par">When all was water, the animals were above the
Galunlati, beyond the arch; but it was very much crowded, and they were
wanting more room. They wondered what was below the water, and at last
Dayunisi, &ldquo;Beaver&rsquo;s Grandchild,&rdquo; the little
Water-beetle, offered to go and see if it could learn. It darted in
every direction over the surface of the water, but could find no firm
place to rest.</p>
<p class="par">Then it dived to the bottom and came up with some soft
mud, which began to grow and spread in every direction until it became
an island which we call the earth. It was afterwards fastened to the
sky, but no one remembers who did it.</p>
<p class="par">At first the earth was flat, and very soft and wet. The
animals were anxious to get down, and sent out different birds to see
if it was yet dry, but they found no place to alight and came back
again to Galunlati. At last it seemed to be time, and they sent out the
Buzzard and told him to go and make ready for them.</p>
<p class="par">This was the Great Buzzard, the father of all the
buzzards we see now. He flew all over the earth, low down, near the
ground, and it was still soft. When he reached the Cherokee country, he
was very tired, and his wings began to flap and strike the ground, and
wherever they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>struck the earth there was a valley, and where
they turned up again, there was a mountain. When the animals above saw
this, they were afraid the whole earth would be mountains, so they
called him back, but the Cherokee country remains full of mountains to
this day.</p>
<p class="par">When the earth was dry and the animals came down, it was
still dark, so they got the sun and set it in a track to go every day
across the island from east to west, just overhead. It was too hot this
way, and Tsiskagili, the Red Crawfish, had his shell scorched red, so
that his meat was spoiled; and the Cherokee do not eat it. The
conjurers put the sun another hand-breadth higher in the air, but it
was still too hot.</p>
<p class="par">They raised it another time, and another, until it was
seven hand-breadths high, and just under the sky arch. Then it was
right, and they left it so. This is why the conjurers call the highest
place <span class="corr" id="xd23e6374" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>Gulkwagine Digalunlatiyun,&rdquo;
&ldquo;the seven height,&rdquo; because it is seven hand-breadths above
the earth. Every day the sun goes along under this arch, and returns at
night on the upper side to the starting place.</p>
<p class="par">There is another world under this, and it is like ours
in everything&mdash;animals, plants, and people&mdash;save that the
seasons are different. The streams that come down from the mountains
are the trails by which the people reach the underworld, and the
springs at their heads are the doorways by which they enter it, but to
do this one must fast and go to water and have one of the underground
people for a guide. We know that the seasons in the underground are
different from ours, because the water in the springs is warmer in the
winter and cooler in the summer than the outer air.</p>
<p class="par">When the animals and the plants were first made&mdash;we
do not know by whom&mdash;they were told to watch and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>keep
awake for seven nights, just as young men now fast and keep awake when
they pray to their medicine. They tried to do this, and nearly all were
awake through the first night, but the next night several dropped off
to sleep, and the third night others were asleep, and then others,
until, on the seventh night, of all the animals, only the owl, the
panther and one or two more were still awake.</p>
<p class="par">To these were given the power to see and to go about in
the dark, and to make prey of the birds and animals which must sleep at
night. Of the trees, only the cedar, the pine, the spruce, the holly
and the laurel were awake to the end, and to them it was given to be
always green and to be greatest for medicine, but to the others it was
said: &ldquo;Because you have not endured to the end you shall lose
your hair every winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Men came after the animals and plants. At first there
were only a brother and sister until he struck her with a fish and told
her to multiply, and so it was. In seven days a child was born to her,
and thereafter every seven days another, and they increased very fast
until there was danger that the world could not keep them. Then it was
made that a woman should have only one child in a year, and it has been
so ever since.</p>

<h3 class="label">MYTH TWO.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>The First Fire.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In the beginning there was no fire, and the world
was cold, until the Thunders (Ani-Hyuntikwalaski) who lived up in
Galunlati, sent their lightning and put fire into the bottom of a
hollow sycamore tree, which grew <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134"
href="#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>on an island. The animals
knew it was there, because they could see the smoke coming out at the
top, but they could not get to it on account of the water, so they held
a council to decide what to do. This was a long time ago.</p>
<p class="par">Every animal that could fly or swim was anxious to go
after the fire. The Raven offered, and because he was so large and
strong they thought he could surely do the work, so he was sent first.
He flew high and far across the water and alighted on the sycamore
tree, but while he was wondering what to do next, the heat had scorched
all his feathers black, and he was frightened and came back without the
fire.</p>
<p class="par">The little Screech-owl (Wahuhu) volunteered to go, and
reached the place safely, but while he was looking down in the hollow
tree a blast of hot air came up and nearly burned out his eyes. He
managed to fly home as best he could, but it was a long time before he
could see well, and his eyes are red to this day.</p>
<p class="par">Then the Hooting Owl (Uguku) and the Horned Owl (Tskili)
went, but by the time they got to the hollow tree the fire was burning
so fiercely that the smoke nearly blinded them, and the ashes carried
up by the wind made white rings about their eyes. They had to come home
again without the fire, but with all of their rubbing they were never
able to get rid of the white rings.</p>
<p class="par">Now, no more of the birds would venture, and so the
little Uksuhi snake, the Black Racer, said he would go through the
water and bring back some fire. He swam across to the island and
crawled through the grass to the tree, and went in by a small hole at
the bottom. The heat and smoke were too much for him, too, and after
dodging about blindly over the hot ashes until he was almost on fire
himself he managed by good luck to get out again at the same hole, but
his body had scorched <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href=
"#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>black, and he has ever since had
the habit of darting and doubling on his track as if trying to escape
from close quarters.</p>
<p class="par">He came back, and the great Blacksnake, Gulegi,
&ldquo;The Climber,&rdquo; offered to go for the fire. He swam over to
the island and climbed up the tree on the outside, as the blacksnake
always does, but when he put his head down into the hole the smoke
choked him so that he fell into the burning stump, and before he could
climb out again he was as black as the Uksuhi.</p>
<p class="par">Now, they held another council, for still there was no
fire, and the world was cold, but the birds, snakes and four-footed
animals all had some excuse for not going, because they were all afraid
to venture near the burning sycamore, until at last Kananeski Amaiyehi
(the Water Spider) said she would go. This is not the water spider that
looks like a mosquito, but the other one, with black downy hair and red
stripes on her body. She can run on the water or dive to the bottom, so
there would be no trouble to get over to the island, but the question
was, how could she bring back the fire?</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll manage that,&rdquo; said the spider,
so she spun a thread from her body and wove it into a tusti bowl, which
she fastened on her back. Then she crossed over to the island and
through the grass to where the fire was still burning. She put one
little coal of fire into her bowl, and came back with it, and ever
since we have had fire, and the spider still keeps her tusti bowl.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long ago, when the world was new, there were seven
boys who used to spend all their time down by the town-house, playing
the gatayusti game, rolling a stone wheel along the ground and sliding
a curved stick after it to strike it. Their mothers scolded but it did
no good, so one day they collected some gatayusti stones and boiled
them in the pot with the corn for dinner.</p>
<p class="par">When the boys came home hungry their mothers dipped out
the stones and said, &ldquo;Since you like the gatayusti better than
the cornfield, take the stones now for your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boys were very angry, and went down to the
town-house, saying, &ldquo;As our mothers treat us this way, let us go
where we shall never trouble them any more.&rdquo; They began a
dance&mdash;some say it was the feather dance&mdash;and went round and
round the town-house, praying to the spirits to help them. At last
their mothers were afraid something was wrong and went out to look for
them.</p>
<p class="par">They saw the boys still dancing around the town-house,
and as they watched they noticed that their feet were off the earth,
and that with every round they rose higher and higher in the air.</p>
<p class="par">They ran to get their children, but it was too late, for
they were already above the roof of the town-house&mdash;all but one,
whose mother managed to pull him down with the gatayusti pole, but he
struck the ground with such force that he sank into it and the earth
closed over him. The other six children circled higher and higher until
they went up to the sky, where we see them now <span class=

the pleiades, which the Cherokee still calls
&ldquo;Anitsutsa<span class="corr" id="xd23e6434" title=

<p class="par">The people grieved long after them, but the mother whose
boy had gone into the ground came every morning and evening to cry over
the spot, until the earth was damp with her tears.</p>
<p class="par">At last a little green shoot sprouted up and grew day by
day until it became the tall tree that we now call the pine, and the
pine is still of the same nature as the stars and holds in itself the
same bright light.</p>

so the next night they watched, and when the dog came from the North,

him. He ran off howling to his home in the North, with the meal
dropping from his mouth as he ran, and leaving behind a white trail

make a raft to get upon when the rain comes, you can be saved, but you
must first throw me into the water.&rdquo; The man did not believe it,
and the dog said, &ldquo;If you want a sign that I speak the truth,
look at the back of my neck.&rdquo; He looked and saw that the
dog&rsquo;s neck had the skin worked off so that the bones stuck
out.</p>
<p class="par">Then he believed the dog, and began to build a raft.
Soon the rain came and he took his family, with plenty of provisions,
and they all got upon it. It rained for a long time, and the water rose
until the mountains were covered and all the people in the world were
drowned. Then the rain stopped and the water went down again, until at
last it was safe to come off the raft.</p>
<p class="par">Now, there was no one alive but the man and his family,
but one day they heard a sound of dancing and shouting on the other
side of the ridge. The man climbed to the top and looked over;
everything was still, but all along the valley he saw great piles of
bones of the people who had been drowned, and then he knew that the
Ghosts had been dancing. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=

<h3 class="main"><i>How the Terrapin Beat the Rabbit.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rabbit was a great runner and a great boaster
of what she could do. No one thought that a Terrapin was anything but a
slow traveler, but he was a great warrior and very boastful, and the
two were always disputing about their speed. At last they agreed to
decide the matter by a race.</p>
<p class="par"></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
</div>
<p class="par"></p>
<p class="par">They fixed the day and the starting place, and arranged
to run across four mountain ridges, and the one who came in first at
the end of the race was to be the winner.</p>
<p class="par">The Rabbit felt so sure of it that he said to the
Terrapin, &ldquo;You know you can&rsquo;t run. You know you can never
win the race, so I&rsquo;ll give you the first ridge and then
you&rsquo;ll have three to cross while I go over four.&rdquo; The
Terrapin said that would be all right, but that night when he went home
to his family he sent for his Terrapin friends and told them he wanted
their help. He said he knew he could not outrun the Rabbit, but he
wanted to stop the Rabbit&rsquo;s boasting. He explained his plan to
his friends and they agreed to help him. When the day came all the
animals were there to see the race. The Rabbit was there with them, but
the Terrapin was gone ahead toward the first ridge, as they had
arranged, and they could hardly see him on account of the tall
grass.</p>
<p class="par">The word was given and the Rabbit <span class="corr" id=
"xd23e6493" title="Not in source">ran</span> off with long jumps up the
mountain, expecting to win the race before the Terrapin could get down
on the other side. But before he got up the mountain he saw the
Terrapin go over the ridge ahead of him. He ran on, and when he reached
the top he looked all around, but could not see the Terrapin on account
of the long grass. He kept on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140"
href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>down the mountain and began
to climb the second ridge, but when he looked up again there was the
Terrapin just going over the top.</p>
<p class="par">Now he was very much surprised, and made his longest
jumps to catch up, but when he got to the top there was the Terrapin
away in front going over the third ridge. The Rabbit was getting tired
now and nearly out of breath, but he kept on down the mountain and up
the other ridge until he got to the top just in time to see the
Terrapin cross the fourth ridge and thus win the race. The Rabbit could
not make another jump, but fell over on the ground, crying, &ldquo;mi,
mi, mi, mi,&rdquo; as the Rabbit does ever since when he is too tired
to run any more.</p>
<p class="par">The race was given to the Terrapin, and all the animals
wondered how he could win against the Rabbit, but he kept still and
never told. It was easy enough, however, because all the
Terrapin&rsquo;s friends look just alike, and he had simply posted one
near the top of each ridge to wait until the Rabbit came in sight and
then climb over and hide in the long grass.</p>
<p class="par">When the Rabbit came on he could not find the Terrapin
and so thought the Terrapin was ahead, and if he had met one of the
other Terrapins he would have thought it the same one, because they
look so much alike. The real Terrapin had posted himself on the fourth
ridge, so as to come in at the end of the race and be ready to answer
questions if the animals suspected anything.</p>
<p class="par">Because the Rabbit had to lie down and lose the race the
conjurer now, when preparing his young men for the ball play, boils a
lot of rabbit hamstrings into soup, and sends some one to pour it
across the path along which the other players have to come in the
morning, so that they may become tired in the same way and lose the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>game. It is not always easy to do this, because
the other party is expecting it and has watchers ahead to prevent
it.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Rabbit and the Tar Wolf.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Once there was such a long spell of dry weather
that there was no more water in the creeks and springs, and the animals
held a council to see what to do about it. They decided to dig a well,
and all agreed to help except the Rabbit, who was a lazy fellow, and
said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to dig for water. The dew on the grass
is enough for me.&rdquo; The others did not like this, but they went to
work together and dug the well.</p>
<p class="par">They noticed by and by that the Rabbit kept sleek and
lively, although it was still dry weather and the water was getting low
in the well. They said, &ldquo;That tricky Rabbit steals our water at
night,&rdquo; so they made a wolf of pine gum and tar and set it up by
the well to scare the thief. That night the Rabbit came, as he had been
coming every night, to drink enough to last him all next day. He saw
the queer black thing by the well and said, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s
there?&rdquo; but the tar wolf said nothing.</p>
<p class="par">He came nearer, but the wolf never moved, so he grew
braver and said, &ldquo;Get out of my way or I will kick you.&rdquo;
Still the wolf never moved and the Rabbit came up and struck it with
its front foot, but the tar held it fast. Now he was angry and said:
&ldquo;Turn my foot loose, or I will strike you with my other front
foot&rdquo;; still the wolf said nothing. Then the Rabbit struck the
wolf with his other foot, and it stuck, and the Rabbit said,
&ldquo;Turn my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name=
"pb142">142</a>]</span>foot loose or I will kick you,&rdquo; and still
the wolf was silent, and then the rabbit kicked with his right hind
foot so hard that it stuck, and still the wolf said nothing; and the
Rabbit said, &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t turn my foot loose, I will kick
you with my left hind foot, which never fails to accomplish what I want
it to do&rdquo;; yet the wolf was silent, and the Rabbit made his last
kick and the foot stuck, just as the others had done.</p>
<p class="par">The Rabbit plead with the wolf to let him go, and yet no
response came, and, at last, when he found he was stuck fast with his
feet, he said: &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t turn me loose I will butt you
with all my might,&rdquo; and in his desperation, he struck with all
his force, and his head stuck fast to the wolf.</p>
<p class="par">In the morning all the animals came down to the well to
drink as usual, and found the Rabbit stuck fast to the wolf of tar, and
they began to discuss what disposition to make of him, so one suggested
that they cut his head off, to which the Rabbit replied, &ldquo;Please
do cut my head off, for it is such an easy death to die,&rdquo; but
this aroused the suspicion of the animals, so that the fox said,
&ldquo;No, we will not do this for he deserves a harsher death than
this,&rdquo; whereupon they all agreed. Then the Wolf suggested that
they burn him alive, to which the Rabbit said, &ldquo;Please Mr. Wolf,
have me burned, for that will be so easy,&rdquo; but this did not
please the audience, and another suggested that they take him to the
briar patch, and throw him into the thickest part of the sharp briars
to scratch him to pieces, to which the Rabbit said, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Fox,
please do not allow me to be thrown into the briars for they stick and
scratch me so much that I could never stand the pain&rdquo;; and they
all with one accord exclaimed, &ldquo;Throw him in,&rdquo; and they
threw him into the briars, and the Rabbit sped away as fast as he
could, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>saying, &ldquo;This is where I was reared, this
is my home, and this is all that I could desire.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Rabbit and the Possum each wanted a wife, but
no one would marry either of them. They talked the matter over and the
Rabbit said, &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get wives here; let&rsquo;s go to
the next settlement. I&rsquo;m the messenger for the council, and
I&rsquo;ll tell the people that I bring an order that everybody must
take a mate at once, and then we&rsquo;ll be sure to get
wives.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Possum thought this a fine plan, so they started off
together to the next town. As the Rabbit traveled faster he got there
first and waited outside until the people noticed him and took him into
the town-house. When the chief came to ask him his business the Rabbit
said he brought an important message from the council that everybody
must get married without delay. So the chief called the people together
and told them the message from the council, whereupon every animal took
a mate at once, and the Rabbit got a wife.</p>
<p class="par">The Possum traveled so slowly that he got there after
all the animals had mated, leaving him still without a wife.</p>
<p class="par">The Rabbit pretended to feel sorry for him and said,
&ldquo;Never mind, I&rsquo;ll carry the message to the people in the
next settlement, and you hurry on as fast as you can, and this time you
will get your wife.&rdquo; So he went on to the next town, and the
Possum followed close after <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href=
"#pb144" name="pb144">144</a>]</span>him. But when the Rabbit got to
the town-house, he sent out the word that, as there had been peace so
long there that everybody was getting lazy, the council had ordered
that there must be war at once, and they must begin right in the
town-house. So they all began fighting, but the Rabbit made four great
leaps and got away just as the Possum came in. Everybody jumped on the
Possum, who had not thought of bringing his weapons on a wedding trip,
and so could not defend himself. They had nearly beaten the life out of
him when he fell over and pretended to be dead until he saw a good
chance to jump up and get away. The Possum never got a wife, but he
remembers the lesson, and ever since he shuts his eyes and pretends to
be dead when the hunter has him in a close place.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">When the Terrapin won the race from the Rabbit
(see Myth Six) all the animals wondered and talked about it a great
deal, because they had always thought the Terrapin slow, although they
knew that he was a warrior and had many conjuring secrets besides.</p>
<p class="par">But the Turkey was not satisfied, and told the others
that there must be some trick about it. Said he, &ldquo;I know the
Terrapin can&rsquo;t run&mdash;he can hardly crawl&mdash;and I&rsquo;m
going to try him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So one day the Turkey met the Terrapin coming home from
war with a fresh scalp hanging from his neck and dragging on the ground
as he traveled. The Turkey <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>laughed at the sight and said:
&ldquo;That scalp don&rsquo;t look right on you. Your neck is too short
and low down to wear it that way. Let me show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The Terrapin agreed and gave the scalp to the Turkey,
who fastened it around his neck. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Turkey,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll walk a little way and you can see how it
looks.&rdquo; So he walked ahead a short distance and then turned and
asked the Terrapin how he liked it. Said the Terrapin, &ldquo;It looks
very nice; it becomes you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll fix it in a different way and let
you see how it looks,&rdquo; said the Turkey. So he gave the string
another pull and walked ahead again. &ldquo;Oh, that looks very
nice,&rdquo; said the Terrapin. But the Turkey kept on walking, and the
Terrapin called to him to bring back the scalp, but he only walked the
faster and broke into a run.</p>
<p class="par">Then the Terrapin got out his bow and by his conjuring
art shot a number of cane splits into the Turkey&rsquo;s legs, to
cripple him so he could not run, which accounts for all the many bones
in the Turkey&rsquo;s legs, that are of no use whatever; but the
Terrapin never caught the Turkey, who still wears the scalp from his
neck.</p>

feathers to make him a collar. This is how the Grouse got his collar of
turkey feathers. They began the lessons, and the Turkey learned very
fast until the Grouse thought it was time for the Turkey to try his
voice. &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Grouse, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stand on
this hollow log, and when I give the signal by tapping on it, you must
halloo as loudly as you can.&rdquo; So he got upon the log ready to tap
on it, as a Grouse does, but when he gave the signal the Turkey was so
eager and excited that he could not raise his voice for a shout, but
only gobbled, and ever since then he gobbles whenever he hears a
noise.</p>

in the beginning to be a water bird, but as he had not been given
either web feet or a good bill he could not make a living.</p>

him a bill like a long sharp awl for a fish-gig or spear.</p>
<p class="par">They made him a fish-gig and fastened it on in front of

best gigger ever since.</p>

and when the mother bird found him there, she went for help to the
Little People, who sent her to the Kingfisher. He came, and after
flying back and forth past the hole a few times, made one dart at the
snake and pulled him out dead.</p>
<p class="par">When they looked they found a hole in the snake&rsquo;s
head where the Kingfisher had pierced it with a slender tugaluna fish,
which he carried in his bill like a lance. From this the Little People
concluded that he would make a first-class gigger if he only had the
right spear, so they gave him his long bill as a reward, and he has
ever since been known among all the fowls and animals as the best
fisherman among them.</p>

met, the Partridge asked leave of the Terrapin to try the whistle.</p>
<p class="par">The Terrapin was afraid to risk it at first, suspecting
some trick, but the Partridge said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give it back
right away, and if you are afraid you can stay with me while I
practice.&rdquo; So the Terrapin let him have the whistle and the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The generic name for snake is inadu. They are all
regarded as inaduwehi, &ldquo;supernaturals,&rdquo; having an intimate
connection with the rain and the thunder gods, and possessing a certain
influence over the other animals and plant tribes. It is said that the
snakes, the deer, and the ginseng act as allies, so that an injury to
one is avenged by the others. The feeling toward snakes is one mingled
with fear and reverence, and every precaution is taken to avoid the
killing or offending one, especially the rattlesnake. He who kills a
snake will soon see others; and should he kill a second one, so many
will come around him, whichever way he may turn, that he will become
dazed at the sight of their glistening eyes and darting tongues, and
will go wandering about like a crazy man, unable to find his way out of
the woods.</p>
<p class="par">To guard against this misfortune there are certain
prayers which the initiated say in order that a snake may not cross
their path, and on meeting the first one of the season the hunter
humbly begs of him, &ldquo;Let us not see each other this
summer.&rdquo; Certain smells, as that of the wild parsnip, and certain
songs, as those of the Unikawi or town-house dance, are offensive to
the snakes and make them angry. For this reason the Unikawi dance is
held only late in the fall, after they have retired to their dens for
the winter. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">When one dreams of being bitten by a snake he must be
treated the same as for the actual bite, because it is the snake ghost
that has bitten him; otherwise the place will swell and ulcerate in the
same way, even though it be years afterwards. For fear of offending
them, even in speaking, it is never said that a man has been bitten by
a snake, but only that he has been &ldquo;scratched by a briar.&rdquo;
Most of the beliefs and customs in this connection have more special
reference to the rattlesnake.</p>

<p class="par">The rattlesnake is called utsanati, which may be
rendered, &ldquo;he has a bell,&rdquo; alluding to the rattles.
According to their myths the rattlesnake was once a man, and was
transformed to his present shape that he might save the human race from
extermination by the Sun, a mission which he accomplished successfully
after others had failed.</p>
<p class="par">By the old men he is also spoken of as &ldquo;The
Thunder&rsquo;s Necklace,&rdquo; and to kill one is to destroy one of
the most prized ornaments of the Thunder-god. In one of the formulas
addressed to the Little Men, the sons of the Thunder, they are implored
to take the disease snake to themselves, because, &ldquo;It is just
what you adorn yourselves with.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">For obvious reasons the rattlesnake is regarded as the
chief of the tribe and is feared and respected accordingly. Few
Cherokee will venture to kill one except under absolute necessity, and
even then the crime must be atoned for by asking pardon of the snake
ghost, either through the mediation of a priest or in person according
to a set formula.</p>
<p class="par">Otherwise, the relatives of the dead snake will send one
of their number to track up the offender and bite him, so that he will
die. The only thing of which it is said that the rattlesnake is afraid
is the plant known as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href=
"#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>campion, or
&ldquo;rattlesnake&rsquo;s master&rdquo; (Silene Stella), which is used
by doctors to counteract the effect of the bite, and it is believed
that a snake will flee in terror from the hunter who carries a small
piece of the root about his person.</p>
<p class="par">Notwithstanding the fear of the rattlesnake, his
rattles, teeth, flesh and oil are greatly prized for occult or medical
uses, the snake being killed for this purpose by certain priests who
know the necessary rites and formulas for obtaining pardon.</p>

<h3 class="label">MYTH SEVENTEEN.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>The Uktena and the Ulunsuti.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long ago&mdash;hilahiyu&mdash;when the Sun became
angry at the people on earth, and sent a sickness to destroy them, the
Little Men changed a man into a monster snake, as large as the trunk of
a tree, with horns, which they called the Uktena, &ldquo;The
Keen-eyed,&rdquo; and sent him to kill her. He failed to do the work,
and the Rattlesnake had to be sent instead, which made the Uktena so
jealous and angry that the people were afraid of him and had him taken
to Galunlati, to stay with the other dangerous things. He left others
behind him, though, nearly as large and dangerous as himself, and they
hide now in the deep pools in the river and about lonely passes in the
high mountains, the places which the Cherokee call, &ldquo;Where the
Uktena stays.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Those who know say that the Uktena with its horns on its
head has a bright blazing crest like a diamond upon its forehead, and
scales glittering like sparks of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb155"
href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>fire upon its body. It has
rings or spots along its whole length, and cannot be wounded except by
shooting in the seventh spot from the head because under this spot are
its heart and its life.</p>
<p class="par">The blazing spot is called Ulunsuti,
&ldquo;Transparent,&rdquo; and he who can win it may become the
greatest wonder-worker of the tribe, but it is worth a man&rsquo;s life
to attempt it, for whoever is seen by the Uktena is so dazed by the
bright light that he runs toward the snake instead of trying to escape.
Even to see the Uktena asleep is death, not to the hunter himself, but
to his family. Of all the daring warriors who have started out in
search of Ulunsu&rsquo;ti only <span class="corr" id="xd23e6734" title=
"Source: Agan-unitsi">Agan-uni-tsi</span> ever came back
successful.</p>
<p class="par">The East Cherokee still keeps the one that he bought. It
is like a transparent crystal, nearly the shape of a cartridge bullet,
with blood-red streaks running thru the center from top to bottom. The
owner keeps it wrapped in a whole deerskin, inside an earthen vessel,
hidden away in a secret cave in the mountains.</p>
<p class="par">Every seven days he feeds it with the blood of small
game, rubbing the blood all over the crystal as soon as the animal has
been killed. Twice a year it must have the blood of a deer or some
other large animal. Should he forget to feed it at the proper time it
would come out of the cave at night in a shape of fire and fly thru the
air to slake its thirst with the life blood of the conjurer or some of
his people.</p>
<p class="par">He may save himself from this danger by telling it, when
he puts it away, that he will not need it again for a long time. It
will then go quietly to sleep and feel no hunger until it is again
brought out to be consulted. Then it must be fed again on blood before
it is used. No white man must ever see it, and no person but the owner
will venture near it for fear of sudden death. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Even the conjurer who keeps it is afraid of it, and
changes its hiding place every once in a while so that it cannot learn
the way out. When he dies it will be buried with him. Otherwise, it
will come out of its cave, like a blazing star, to search for his
grave, night after night for seven years, when, if still not able to
find him, it will go back to sleep forever where he has placed it.</p>
<p class="par">Whoever owns the Ulunsuti is sure of success in hunting,
love, rain-making and every other business, but its great use is in
life prophecy. When it is consulted for this purpose the future is seen
mirrored in the clear crystal as a tree is reflected in the quiet
stream below, and the conjurer knows whether the sick man will recover,
whether the warrior will return from the battle, or whether the youth
will live to be old.</p>

<h3 class="label">MYTH EIGHTEEN.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>Agan-uni-tsi&rsquo;s Search for the
Uktena.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">In one of their battles with the Showano, who are
all magicians, the Cherokee captured a great medicine-man, whose name
was Agan-uni-tsi, &ldquo;The Ground-Hog&rsquo;s Mother.&rdquo; They had
tied him ready for the torture when he begged for his life, and
engaged, if they spared him, to find for them the great wonder-worker,
the Ulunsuti. Now, the Ulunsuti is like a blazing star set in the
forehead of the great Uktena serpent, and the medicine-man who could
possess it might do marvelous things, but everyone knew that this could
not be, because it was certain death to meet the Uktena. They warned
him of all this, but he only answered that his medicine was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>strong and that he was not afraid. So they gave
him his life on that condition and he began the search.</p>
<p class="par">The Uktena used to lie in wait in lonely places to
surprise its victims, and especially haunted the dark passes of the
Great Smoky Mountains. Knowing this, the magician went first to a gap
in the range on the far northern border of the Cherokee country. He
searched there and found a monster blacksnake, larger than had ever
been known before, but it was not what he was looking for, and he
laughed at it as something too small for notice.</p>
<p class="par">Coming southward to the next gap he found there a
moccasin snake, the largest ever seen, but when the people wondered he
said it was nothing. In the next gap he found a green snake and called
the people to see it, (the pretty salikwaya), but when they found an
immense greensnake coiled up in the path they ran away in fear.</p>
<p class="par">Coming on to Utawa-gun-ti, the Bald mountain, he found
there a great diyahali (lizard) basking, but, although it was large and
terrible to look at, it was not what he was looking for and he paid no
attention to it. Going still further south to Walasi-yi, the Frog
place, he found a great frog squatting in the gap but when the people
who came to see it were frightened like the others and ran away from
the monster he mocked at them for being afraid of a frog and went on to
the next gap.</p>
<p class="par">He went on to Duni-skwa-lgun-yi, the Gap of the Forked
Antler, and to the enchanted lake of Atagahi, and at each he found
monstrous reptiles, but he said they were nothing.</p>
<p class="par">He thought that the Uktena might be hiding in the deep
water at Tlanusiyi, the Leech place, on Hiwassee, where other strange
things had been seen before, and going there he dived far down under
the surface. He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158"
name="pb158">158</a>]</span>saw turtles and water snakes, and two
immense sun-perches rushed at him and retreated again, but that was
all.</p>
<p class="par">Other places he tried, going always southward, and at
last on Gahuti mountain he found the Uktena asleep.</p>
<p class="par">Turning without noise, he ran swiftly down the
mountainside as far as he could go with one long breath, nearly to the
bottom of the slope. Then he stopped and piled up a lot of pine-cones,
and inside of it he dug a deep trench. Then he set fire to the cones
and came back again up the mountain.</p>
<p class="par">The Uktena was still asleep, and, putting an arrow to
his bow, <span class="corr" id="xd23e6776" title=
"Source: Agan-unitsi">Agan-uni-tsi</span> shot and sent the arrow
through its heart, which was under the seventh spot from the
serpent&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p class="par">The great snake raised his head, with the diamond in
front flashing fire, and came straight at his enemy, but the magician,
turning quickly, ran at full speed down the mountain, cleared the
circle of fire and the trench at one bound, and lay down on the ground
inside. The Uktena tried to follow, but the arrow was thru his heart,
and in another moment he rolled over in his death struggle, spitting
poison over all the mountainside. The poison drops could not pass the
circle of fire, but only hissed and sputtered in the blaze, and the
magician on the inside was untouched except by one small drop which
struck upon his head as he lay close to the ground; but he did not know
it. The blood, too, as poisonous as the froth, poured from the
Uktena&rsquo;s wound and down the slope in a stream, but it ran into
the trench and left him unharmed.</p>
<p class="par">The dying monster rolled over and over down the
mountain, breaking down large trees in its path until it reached the
bottom. Then Agan-uni-tsi called every bird <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>in
all the woods to come to the feast, and so many came that when they
were done not even the bones were left. After seven days he went by
night to the spot.</p>
<p class="par">The body and the bones of the snake were gone, all eaten
by the birds, but he saw a bright light shining in the darkness, and
going over to it he found, resting on a low-hanging branch, where a
raven had dropped it<span class="corr" id="xd23e6788" title=
"Source: .">,</span> the diamond from the head of Uktena. He wrapped it
up carefully and took it with him, and from that time he became the
greatest medicine-man in the whole tribe.</p>
<p class="par">When he came down again to the settlement the people
noticed a small snake hanging from his head where the single drop of
poison from the Uktena had struck him; but so long as he lived he
himself never knew that it was there.</p>
<p class="par">Where the blood of the Uktena had filled the trench a
lake formed afterwards, and the water was black and in this water the
women used to dye the cane splits for their baskets.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Red Man and the Uktena.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Two brothers went hunting together, and when they
came to a good camping place in the mountains they made a fire, and
while one gathered bark to put up a shelter, the other started up the
creek to look for a deer. Soon he heard a noise on the top of the ridge
as if two animals were fighting. He hurried thru the brush to see what
it might be, and when he came to the spot he found a great Uktena
coiled around a man and choking <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160"
href="#pb160" name="pb160">160</a>]</span>him to death. The man was
fighting for his life, and called out to the hunter, &ldquo;Help me,
nephew; he is your enemy as well as mine.&rdquo; The hunter took good
aim, and, drawing the arrow to the head, sent it thru the body of the
Uktena, so that the blood spouted from the hole. The snake loosed its
coils with a snapping noise, and went tumbling down the ridge into the
valley, tearing up the earth like a water-spout as it rolled.</p>
<p class="par">The stranger stood up, and it was the Asgaya Gigagei,
the Red Man of the Lightning. He said to the hunter: &ldquo;You have
helped me, and now I will reward you, and give you a medicine so that
you can always find game.&rdquo; They waited until it was dark, and
then went down the ridge to where the dead Uktena had rolled, but by
this time the birds and the insects had eaten the body and only the
bones were left.</p>
<p class="par">In one place were flashes of light coming up from the
ground, and on digging here, just under the surface, the Red Man found
a scale of the Uktena. Next he went over to the tree that had been
struck by lightning, and gathering a handful of splinters he made a
fire and burned the scale of the Uktena to a coal. He wrapped this in a
piece of deerskin and gave it to the hunter, saying: &ldquo;As long as
you keep this you can always kill game.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then he told the hunter that when he went back to camp
he must hang up the medicine on a tree outside, because it was very
strong and dangerous. He told him also that when he went into the cabin
he would find his brother lying inside nearly dead on account of the
presence of the Uktena scale, but he must take a small piece of cane,
which the Red Man gave him, and scrape a little of it into water and
give it to his brother to drink, and he would be well again.</p>
<p class="par">Then the Red Man was gone, and the hunter could not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>see where he went. He returned to camp alone,
and found his brother very sick, but soon cured him with the medicine
from the cane, and that day and the next, and every day after, he found
game whenever he went for it.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Hunter and the Uksuhi.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A man living down in Georgia came to visit some
relatives at Hickory-log. He was a great hunter, and after resting for
some days, got ready to go into the mountains. His friends warned him
not to go toward the north, as in that direction, near a certain large
uprooted tree, there lived a dangerous monster Uksuhi snake.</p>
<p class="par">It kept constant watch, and whenever it could spring
upon an unwary hunter it would coil about him and crush out his life in
its folds, and then drag the dead body down the mountainside into a
deep hole in Hiwassee river. He listened quietly to the warning, but
all they said only made him the more anxious to see such a monster, so,
without saying anything of his intentions, he left the settlement and
took his way directly up the mountain toward the north.</p>
<p class="par">Soon he came to the fallen tree and climbed upon the
trunk, and there, sure enough, on the other side was the great Uksuhi
stretched out in the grass, with its head raised, but looking the other
way.</p>
<p class="par">It was as large as a common trunk of a tree, and at the
sight of this terrible monster the hunter became so much frightened
that he made haste to get down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162"
href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span>from the log and started to
run; but the great snake had heard him approach, and the noise as he
started to make his escape, whereupon it turned quickly and pursued
him.</p>
<p class="par">Up the ridge the hunter ran, the snake close behind him,
then down the other side toward the river, but with all his running the
Uksuhi gained rapidly, and just as he reached the low ground it caught
up with him and wrapped around him, pinning one arm down by his side,
but leaving the other free. Now, it gave him a terrible squeeze that
almost broke his ribs, and then began to drag him along toward the
water. With his free hand the hunter began to clutch at the bushes as
they passed, but the snake turned his head and blew its sickening
breath into his face, until he had to let go his hold.</p>
<p class="par">Again and again this happened, and all the time they
were getting nearer and nearer to a deep hole in the river, when,
almost at the last moment, a lucky thought came into the hunter&rsquo;s
mind. He was sweating all over from his run across the mountain, and
suddenly remembered to have heard that snakes cannot bear the smell of
perspiration. Putting his free hand into his bosom he worked it around
under his armpit until it was covered with perspiration. Then
withdrawing it, he grasped at a bush until the snake turned its head,
when he quickly slapped his sweaty hand on its nose. The Uksuhi gave
one gasp almost as if it had been wounded, loosened its coil, and
glided swiftly away thru the bushes, leaving the hunter, bruised but
not disabled, to make his way home to the Hickory-log. <span class=

<h3 class="label">MYTH TWENTY-ONE.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>The Ustutli.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was once a great serpent, called the
Ustutli, that made its haunt upon Cohutta mountain. It was called the
Ustutli or &ldquo;foot&rdquo; snake, because it did not glide like
other snakes, but had feet at each end of its body, and moved by
strides or jerks, like a great measuring worm.</p>
<p class="par">These feet were three-cornered and flat and could hold
to the ground like suckers. It had no legs, but would raise itself up
on its hind feet, with its snaky head high in the air until it found a
good place to take a fresh hold; then it would bend down and grip its
front feet to the ground while it drew its body up from behind.</p>
<p class="par">It could cross rivers and deep ravines by throwing its
head across, and getting a grip with its front feet, and then swing its
body over. Wherever its footprints were found there was danger.</p>
<p class="par">It used to bleat like a young fawn, and when the hunter
heard a fawn bleat in the woods he never looked for it, but hurried
away in the other direction. Up the mountain or down, nothing could
escape the Ustutli&rsquo;s pursuit, but along the side of the ridge it
could not go, because the great weight of its swinging head broke its
hold on the ground when it moved sideways.</p>
<p class="par">It came to pass after awhile that not a hunter about
Cohutta would venture near the mountain for dread of the Ustutli.</p>
<p class="par">At last a man from one of the northern settlements came
down to visit some relatives in that neighborhood. When he arrived they
made a feast for him, but only had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164"
href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>corn and beans, and excused
themselves for having no meat because the hunters were afraid to go
into the mountains. He asked the reason, and when they told him he said
he would go himself tomorrow and either bring in a deer or find the
Ustutli. They tried to dissuade him from it, but as he insisted upon
going they warned him that if a fawn bleated in the thicket he must run
at once and if the snake came after him he must not try to run down the
mountain, but along the side of the ridge.</p>
<p class="par">In the morning he started out, and went directly to the
mountain. Working his way thru the bushes at the base, he suddenly
heard a fawn bleat in front. He guessed at once that it was the
Ustutli, but he had made up his mind to see it, so he did not turn
back, but went straight forward, and there, sure enough, was the
monster, with its great head in the air, as high as the pine branches,
looking in every direction to discover a deer, or maybe a man, for
breakfast. It saw him and came at him at once, moving in jerky strides,
every one the length of a tree trunk, holding its scaly head high above
the bushes and bleating as it came. The hunter was so badly frightened
that he lost his wits entirely and started to run directly up the
mountain.</p>
<p class="par">The great snake came after him, gaining half its length
on him every time it took a fresh grip with its fore feet, and would
have caught the hunter before he reached the top of the ridge, but that
he suddenly remembered the warning and changed his course to run along
the side of the mountain. At once the snake began to lose ground, for
every time it raised itself up the weight of its body threw it out of a
straight line and made it fall a little lower down the side of the
ridge. It tried to recover itself, but now the hunter gained and kept
on until <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>he turned the end of the ridge and left the
snake out of sight. Then he cautiously climbed to the top and looked
over and saw the Ustutli still slowly working its way toward the
summit.</p>
<p class="par">He went down to the base of the mountain, opened his
fire pouch, and set fire to the grass and leaves. Soon the fire ran all
around the mountain and began to climb upward.</p>
<p class="par">When the great serpent smelled the smoke and saw the
flames coming, it forgot all about the hunter and turned to make all
speed for a high cliff near the summit. It reached the rock and got
upon it, but the fire followed and caught the dead pines about the base
of the cliff until the heat made the Ustutli&rsquo;s scales crack.</p>
<p class="par">Taking a close grip of the rock with its hind feet, it
raised its body and put forth all its strength in an effort to spring
across the wall of fire that surrounded it, but the smoke choked it and
its hold loosened and it fell among the blazing pine trunks and

cliff is highest and the river far below, there lived in the old time a
great snake called the Uwtsunta (or bouncer), because it moved by jerks
like a measuring worm, with only one part of its body on the ground at
a time. It stayed generally on the east side, where <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>the
sun came first in the morning, and used to cross by reaching over from
the highest point of the cliff until it could get a grip on the other
side, when it would pull over the rest of its body.</p>
<p class="par">It was so immense that when it was thus stretched
across, its shadow darkened the whole valley below.</p>
<p class="par">For a long time the people did not know it was there,
but when at last they found out that such a monster inhabited the
country, they were afraid to live in the valley, so that it was
deserted long before the Indians were removed from the country.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Snake Boy.</i></h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">There was a boy who used to go bird hunting every
day, and all the birds he brought home to give to his grandmother, who
was very fond of him. This made the rest of the family jealous, and
they treated him in such fashion that at last one day he told his
grandmother he would leave them all, but that she must not grieve for
him.</p>
<p class="par">Next morning he refused to eat any breakfast, but went
off hungry to the woods and was gone all day. In the evening he
returned, bringing with him a pair of deer horns, and went directly to
the hothouse (Asi), where his grandmother was waiting for him. He told
the old woman that he must be alone that night, so she got up and went
into the house where the others were.</p>
<p class="par">At early daybreak she came again to the hothouse and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>looked in, and there she saw an immense Uktena
that filled the Asi, with horns on its head, but still with two human
legs instead of a snake&rsquo;s tail.</p>
<p class="par">It was all that was left of her boy. He spoke to her and
told her to leave him, and she went away again from the door. When the
sun was well up, the Uktena began slowly to crawl out, but it was full
noon before it was all out of the Asi. It made a terrible hissing noise
as it came out, and all the people ran from it.</p>
<p class="par">It crawled on thru the settlement, leaving a broad trail
in the ground behind it, until it came to a deep bend in the river,
where it plunged in and went under the water.</p>
<p class="par">The grandmother grieved much for the boy, until the
others of the family got angry and told her that she thought so much of
him that she ought to go and stay with him. So she left them and went
along the trail made by the Uktena to the river and walked directly
into the water and disappeared. Once after that a man fishing near the
place saw her sitting on a large rock in the river, looking just as she
had always looked, but as soon as she caught sight of him she jumped
into the water and was gone.</p>

<p class="par first">Two hunters, both for some reason under a tabu
against the meat of a squirrel or turkey, had gone into the woods
together. When evening came, they found a good camping place and
lighted a fire to prepare their <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168"

killed several squirrels during the day, and now got ready to broil
them over the fire.</p>
<p class="par">His companion warned him that if he broke the tabu and
ate squirrel meat he would become a snake, but the other laughed and
said that was only a conjurer&rsquo;s story. He went on with the
preparation, and when the squirrels were roasted made his supper of
them and then lay down by the fire to sleep.</p>
<p class="par">Late that night his companion was aroused by groaning,
and on looking around he found the other lying on the ground rolling
and twisting in agony, and with the lower part of his body already
changed to the body and tail of a large watersnake. The man was still
able to speak and call loudly for help, but his companion could do
nothing, but only sit by and try to comfort him while he watched the
arms sink into his body and the skin take on a scaly change that
mounted gradually toward the neck, until at last even the head was a
serpent&rsquo;s head and the great snake crawled away from the fire and
down the bank into the river, and was never seen again.</p>

<h3 class="main"><i>The Rattlesnake&rsquo;s Revenge.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">One day in the olden times, when we could still
talk with other creatures, while some children were playing about the
house, their mother inside heard them scream. Running outside she found
that a rattlesnake had crawled from the grass, and taking up a stick
she killed it. The father was out hunting in the mountains, and that
evening when coming home after dark thru the gap, he heard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name="pb169">169</a>]</span>a
strange wailing sound. Looking about he found that he had come into the
midst of a whole company of rattlesnakes, all of which had their mouths
open and seemed to be crying. He asked them the reason of their
trouble, and they told him that his own wife had that day killed their
chief, the Yellow Rattlesnake, and they were just now about to send the
Black Rattlesnake to take revenge.</p>
<p class="par">The hunter said he was very sorry, but they told him
that if he spoke the truth that he must be ready to make satisfaction
and give his wife as a sacrifice for the life of their chief. Not
knowing what might happen otherwise, he consented. They then told him
that the Black Rattlesnake would go home with him and coil up just
outside the door in the dark. He must go inside, where he would find
his wife awaiting him, and ask her to get him a fresh drink of water
from the spring. That was all. He went home and knew that the Black
Rattlesnake was following. It was night when he arrived and very dark,
but he found his wife waiting with his supper ready. He sat down and
asked for a drink of water. She handed him a gourd full from the jar,
but he said he wanted it fresh from the spring, so she took a bowl and
went out of the door. The next moment he heard a cry, and going out he
found that the Black Rattlesnake had bitten her and that she was
already dying.</p>
<p class="par">He stayed with her until she was dead, when the Black
Rattlesnake came out from the grass again and said his tribe was now
satisfied.</p>
<p class="par">He then taught the hunter a prayer song, and
said<span class="corr" id="xd23e6936" title="Source: .">,</span>
&ldquo;When you meet any of us hereafter sing this song and we will not
hurt you; but if by accident one of us should bite one of your tribe,
then sing this song over him and he will recover.&rdquo; And the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">On the north bank of Little Tennessee river, in a
bend below the mouth of Citico creek, in Blount County, Tennessee, is a
high cliff hanging over the water, and about half way up the face of
the rock is a cave with two openings. The rock projects outward above
the cave, so that the mouth cannot be seen from above, and it seems
impossible to reach the cave either from above or below.</p>
<p class="par">There are white streaks in the rock from the cave down
to the water. The Cherokee call it Tlanuwai (the place of the Great
Mythic Hawk).</p>
<p class="par">In the old time, away back soon after the creation, a
pair of Tlanuwas had their nest in this cave. They were immense birds,
larger than any that live now, and very strong and savage.</p>
<p class="par">They were forever flying up and down the river, and used
to come into the settlements and carry off dogs and even young children
playing near the houses. No one could reach the nest to kill them, and
when the people tried to shoot them the arrows only glanced off and
were seized and carried away in the talons of the Tlanuwas.</p>
<p class="par">At last the people went to a great medicine man, who
promised to help them. Some were afraid that if he failed to kill the
Tlanuwas they would take revenge on the people, but the medicine man
said he could fix that. He made a long rope of linn bark, just as the
Cherokee still do, with loops in it for his feet, and had the people
let him down from the top of the cliff at a time when he knew that the
old birds were away.</p>
<p class="par">When he came opposite the mouth of the cave he still
could not reach it, because the rocks above hung over, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>so
he swung himself backward and forward several times until the rope
swung near enough for him to pull himself into the cave with a hooked
stick that he carried, which he managed to fasten in some bushes
growing at the entrance.</p>

of the cave were the bones of all sorts of animals and children that
had been carried there by the hawks. He pulled the young ones out of
the nest and threw them over the cliff into the deep water below, where
a great Uktena serpent that lived there finished them.</p>
<p class="par">Just then he saw the two old ones coming, and had hardly
time to climb up again to the top of the rock before they reached the
nest.</p>
<p class="par">When they found the nest empty they were furious, and
circled round and round in the air until they saw the snake put its
head from the water. Then they darted straight downward, and while one
seized the snake in his talons and flew far up in the sky with it, his
mate struck at it and bit off piece after piece until nothing was left.
They were so high up that when the pieces fell they made holes in the
rocks, which are still to be seen there, at the place which we call,
&ldquo;Where the Tlanuwa cut it up,&rdquo; opposite the mouth of
Citico. Then the two hawks circled up and up until they went out of
sight, and they have never been seen any more. <span class=

<h3 class="main"><i>The Hunter and the Tlanuwa.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">A hunter out in the woods one day saw a Tlanuwa
overhead and tried to hide from it, but the great bird had already seen
him, and, sweeping down, struck its claws into his hunting pack, and
carried him far up into the air. As it flew, the Tlanuwa, which was a
mother-bird, spoke and told the hunter that he need not be afraid, as
she would not hurt him, but only wanted him to stay awhile with her
young ones to guard them until they were old enough to leave the
nest.</p>
<p class="par">At last they alighted at the mouth of a cave in the face
of a steep cliff. Inside, the water was dripping from the roof, and at
the farther end was a nest of sticks in which were two young birds.</p>
<p class="par">The old Tlanuwa set the hunter down and then flew away,
returning soon with a fresh-killed deer, which it tore to pieces,
giving the first piece to the hunter and then feeding the two young
hawks.</p>
<p class="par">The hunter stayed in the cave for many days until the
young birds were nearly grown, and every day the old mother bird would
fly away from the nest and return in the evening with a deer or a bear,
of which she always gave the first piece to the hunter. He grew very
anxious to see his home again, but the Tlanuwa kept telling him not to
be uneasy, but to wait a little while longer. At last he made up his
mind to escape from the cave and finally studied out the plan.</p>
<p class="par">The next morning, after the great hawk had gone, he
dragged one of the young birds to the mouth of the cave and tied
himself to one of its legs with a strap from his hunting pack. Then
with the flat side of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href=
"#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>tomahawk he struck it several
times on the head until it was dazed and helpless, then pushed the bird
and himself together off the shelf of rock into the air. They fell far,
far down toward the earth, but the air from below held up the
bird&rsquo;s wings, so that it was almost as if they were flying. As
the Tlanuwa revived it tried to fly upward toward the nest, but the
hunter struck it again with his hatchet until it was dazed and dropped
again.</p>
<p class="par">At last they came down in the top of a poplar tree, when
the hunter cut the strap from the leg of the bird and let it fly away,
first pulling out a feather from its wing. He climbed down from the
tree and went home to the settlement, but when he looked in his pack
for the feather, he found that he only had a stone, for the Great
Mythic Hawk had power to turn many objects into whatever it
pleased.</p>

<h3 class="label">MYTH TWENTY-EIGHT.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>Utlunta, the Spear Finger.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long, long ago, there lived in the mountains a
terrible ogress, a woman monster, whose food was human livers. She
could take on any shape that she pleased, or that suited her purpose,
but in her right form she looked very much like an old woman, excepting
that her whole body was covered with a skin as hard as a rock, that no
weapon could wound or penetrate, and that on her right hand she had a
long, stony finger of bone, like an awl or spear-head, with which she
stabbed everyone to whom she could get near enough. On account of this
fact she <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>was called Utlunta, &ldquo;Spear Finger,&rdquo;
and on account of her stony skin she was sometimes called Nunyunuwi,
&ldquo;Stone-dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">There was another stone-clothed monster that killed
people, but that is a different story.</p>
<p class="par">Spear-finger had such power over stone that she could
easily lift and carry immense rocks, and could cement them together by
merely striking one against another. To get over the rough country more
easily she undertook to build a great bridge through the air from
Nunyutlugunyi, the &ldquo;Tree Rock,&rdquo; on Hiwassee, over to
Sanigilagi (Whiteside Mountain, in Jackson County, North Carolina,) on
the Blue Ridge, and had it well started from the top of &ldquo;Tree
rock&rdquo; when the lightning struck it and scattered the fragments
along the whole ridge, where the pieces can still be seen by those who
go there.</p>
<p class="par">She used to range all over the mountains about the heads
of the streams and in the dark passes of Nantahala, always hungry and
looking for victims. Her favorite haunt on the Tennessee side of the
Great Smoky Mountains was about the gap on the trail where Chilhowee
Mountains come down to the river.</p>
<p class="par">Sometimes the old woman would approach along the trail
where the children were picking strawberries or playing near the
village, and would say to them coaxingly, &ldquo;Come, my grand
children, come to your granny and let granny dress your hair.&rdquo;
When some little girl ran up and laid her head in the old woman&rsquo;s
lap to be petted and combed, the old witch would gently run her fingers
thru the child&rsquo;s hair until it went to sleep, when she would stab
the little one thru the heart or back of the neck with the long awl
finger, which she had kept hidden under her robe. Then she would take
out the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>liver and eat it. She would enter the house by
taking the appearance of one of the family who happened to have gone
out for a short time, and would watch her chance to stab some one with
her long finger and take out his liver. She could stab him without
being noticed, and often the victim did not even know it himself at the
time&mdash;for it left no wound and caused no pain&mdash;but went on
about his own affairs, until all at once he felt weak and began to pine
away, and was always sure to die, because Spear-finger had taken his
liver.</p>
<p class="par">When the Cherokee went out in the fall, according to
their custom, to burn leaves off from the mountains in order to get the
chestnuts on the ground, they were never safe, for the old witch was
always on the lookout, and as soon as she saw the smoke rise she knew
there were Indians there and she would sneak up and try to surprise one
alone. So as well as they could they would try to keep together, and
were very cautious of allowing any stranger to approach the camp. But
if one went to the spring for a drink, they never knew but it might be
the liver-eater that came back and sat with them. At last a great
council was held to devise some means to get rid of the old witch
before she should destroy everybody. The people came from all around to
Nikwasi, (mound now near Franklin, N. C.) and after much talking it was
decided that the best way to secure her demise would be to trap her in
a pitfall where all the warriors could attack her at once. So they dug
a deep pitfall across the path and covered it over with earth and grass
as if the ground had never been disturbed. Then they kindled a large
fire of brush near the trail and hid themselves in the laurels, because
they knew that she would come as soon as she saw the smoke.</p>
<p class="par">Sure enough they soon saw an old woman coming along
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>the trail. She looked very much like an old
woman that they knew in the village, and although several of the wiser
men wanted to shoot at her, the others interfered, because they did not
want to hurt one of their own people. The old woman came slowly along
the trail, with one hand under her blanket, until she stepped upon the
pitfall and tumbled through the brush top into the deep hole below.
Then, at once, she showed her true nature, and instead of the old
feeble woman there was the terrible Utlunta with her stony skin, and
her sharp awl finger reaching out in every direction for some one to
stab.</p>
<p class="par">The hunters rushed out from the thicket and surrounded
the pit, but shoot as true and as often as they could, the arrows
struck the stony mail of the witch only to be broken and fall useless
at her feet, while she taunted them and tried to climb out of the pit
to get at them. They kept out of her way, but were only wasting their
arrows when a small bird, Utsugi, the titmous, perched on a tree
overhead and began to sing, &ldquo;un, un, un.&rdquo; They thought it
was saying unqhu, heart, meaning that they should aim at the heart of
the stone witch. They directed their arrows where the heart should be,
but the arrows only glanced off with the flint heads broken.</p>
<p class="par">Then they caught the Utsugi and cut off its tongue, so
that ever since its tongue is short and everybody knows that it is a
liar.</p>
<p class="par">When the hunters let it go, it flew straight up into the
sky until it was out of sight, and it never came back any more, and the
titmouse that we know now is only an image of the other.</p>
<p class="par">They kept up the fight without result until another
bird, little Tsikilili, the chickadee, flew down from a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href="#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>tree
and alighted upon the witch&rsquo;s right hand. The warriors took this
as a sign that they must aim there, and they were right, for her heart
was on the inside of her hand, which she kept doubled up into a fist,
this same awl-hand with which she had stabbed so many people. Now she
was frightened in earnest, and began to rush furiously at them with her
long awl finger, and to jump about in the pit to dodge the arrows,
until at last an arrow struck her just where the awl finger joined her
wrist and she fell down dead. Ever since then the Tsikilili is known as
a truth-teller, and when a man is away on a journey, if this bird comes
and perches near the house and chirps its song, his friends know that
he will soon reach his home in safety, and his friends will greet him
upon his arrival.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">This is what the old men used to tell us when we
were boys. Once when all the people of the settlement were out in the
mountains on a great hunt, one man who had gone ahead climbed to the
top of a high ridge and found a large river on the other side.</p>
<p class="par">While he was looking across he saw an old man walking
about on the opposite ridge, with a cane that seemed to be made of some
bright, shining rock. The hunter watched and saw that every little
while the old man would point his cane in a certain direction, then
draw it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>back and smell the end of it. At last he pointed
it in the direction of the hunter&rsquo;s camp on the other side of the
mountain, and this time when he drew back the staff he sniffed it
several times as if it smelled very good, and then started along the
ridge straight for the camp. He moved very slowly, with the help of the
cane, until he reached the end of the ridge, when he threw the cane out
into the air and it became a bridge of shining rock stretching across
the river.</p>
<p class="par">After he had crossed over upon the bridge it became a
cane again and the old man picked it up and started over the mountain
toward the camp. The hunter was frightened, and felt sure that it meant
mischief, so he hurried on down the mountain and took the shortest
trail back to the camp to get there before the old man. When he got
there and told his story the medicine-man said the old man was a wicked
cannibal monster called Nunyunuwi, &ldquo;Dressed in Stone,&rdquo; who
lived in the Nantahala mountains, and was always going about thru the
forest looking for some hunter that he might kill and eat him.</p>
<p class="par">It was very hard to escape from him, because his cane
guided him as a dog, and it was nearly as hard to kill him, for his
body was entirely covered with a skin of solid rock. If he came he
would kill and eat them all, and there was only one way to save their
lives.</p>
<p class="par">He could not bear to look upon a woman, and if they
could bring to the path seven married women, that the sight of them
would kill him, and they would rid themselves of him. So they ran
swiftly and brought quickly as many women as they could find, and
placed them <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>along the trail, and when the old man came, he
saw one woman standing near the trail and the very sight of her made
him sick and he cried out, &ldquo;Yu, my grandchild, I hate the sight
of woman!&rdquo; He hurried past her and in a moment he saw the second
woman standing as he had seen the other, and he cried out again,
&ldquo;Yu! my child; I hate the tribe of women, and he hurried past
her, and he continued along the trail until he came to the seventh, and
by this time he had become so much enraged that he fell down almost
dead. Then the medicine-man drove seven sourwood switches through his
body and pinned him to the ground, and when night came they piled great
logs over him and set fire to them, and all the people gathered around
to see. Nunyunuwi was a great adawehi and knew many secrets, and now as
the fire came close to him he began to talk, and told them the medicine
for all kinds of sickness. At midnight he began to sing, and sang the
hunting songs for calling up the bear and deer and all the animals of
the woods and mountains.</p>
<p class="par">As the blaze grew hotter his voice sank lower and lower,
until at last when the daylight came, the logs were a heap of white
ashes and the voice was still. Then the medicine-man told them to rake
off the ashes, and where the body had lain they found only a large lump
of wadi paint and a magic Ulunsuti stone. He kept the stone for
himself, and calling the people around him he painted them on the face
and breast with the red wadi, and whatever each person prayed for while
the painting was being done, whether for hunting success, for working
skill, or for long life&mdash;that gift was his. <span class=

Dakwa, which lived in the Tennessee river where Toco creek comes in at
Dakwai, the &ldquo;Dakwa place,&rdquo; above the mouth of Tellico, and
which was so large that it could easily swallow a man. Once a canoe
filled with warriors was crossing over from the town on the other side
of the river, when the Dakwa suddenly rose up under the boat and threw
them all into the air. As they came down it swallowed one with a single
snap of its jaws and dived with him to the bottom of the river.</p>
<p class="par">As soon as the hunter came to his senses he found that
he had not been hurt, but it was so hot and close inside the Dakwa that
he was nearly smothered. As he groped around in the dark his hand
struck a lot of mussel shells which the fish had swallowed, and taking
one of these for a knife he began to cut his way out, until soon the
fish grew uneasy at the scraping inside his stomach and came up to the
top of the water for air. He kept on cutting until the fish was in such
pain that it swam this way and that across the stream and thrashed the
water into foam with its tail. Finally the hole was so large that he
could look out, and found that the fish was resting in shallow water
near the shore. The Dakwa soon became so sick from the wound that it
vomited the hunter out of its mouth, and he with the others made their
escape to Tellico, but the juices in the stomach of the fish made the
hair fall from the head of the hunter so that he was bald ever after
that. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">(This is the scene of the myth upon which the
story of Occoneechee is founded.)</p>
<p class="par">Westward from the headwaters of Oconaluftee river, in
the wildest depths of the Great Smoky Mountains, which form the line
between North Carolina and Tennessee, is the enchanted lake of Atagahi,
&ldquo;Gall place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Although all of the Cherokee know that it is there, no
one has ever seen it, for the way is so difficult that only the animals
know how to reach it. Should a stray hunter come near the place he
would know of it by the whirring sound of the wings of thousands of
wild ducks and pigeons flying about the lake, but on reaching the spot
he would find only a dry flat, without bird or animal or blade of
grass, unless he had first sharpened his spiritual vision by prayer and
fasting and an all-night vigil.</p>
<p class="par">Because the lake is not seen, some people think that the
lake is dried up long ago, but this is not true. To one that had kept
watch and fasted all the night it would appear at daybreak as a
wide-extending, but shallow sheet of pure water, fed by springs
spouting from the high cliffs around. In the water are all kinds of
fish and reptiles, and swimming upon the surface or flying overhead are
great flocks of ducks and pigeons, while all about the shore are bear
tracks crossing in every direction. It is the medicine lake of the
birds and animals, and whenever a bear is wounded by the hunter he
makes his way thru the woods to this lake and plunges into the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>water, and when he comes out upon the other side
his wounds are healed, and for this reason the animals keep the lake
invisible to the hunter.</p>

he would take her back to his own country, so at last they

<p class="par">They were married and he took his bride back to his own

ice houses. The next day, when the sun rose, the houses began to leak,
and as it climbed higher the houses began to melt, and it grew warmer
and warmer, until finally the people came to the young husband and told
him he must send his wife home again, or the weather would get so warm
that the whole settlement would be melted. He loved his wife and so
held out as long as he could, but as the sun grew hotter the people

<h3 class="main"><i>The Ice Man.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Once when the people were burning the woods in the
fall, and the blaze set fire to a poplar tree, which continued to burn
until the fire went down into the roots and burned a great hole in the
ground. It burned, and burned, and the hole grew constantly larger,
until the people became frightened and were afraid that it would burn
the whole world. They tried to put out the fire, but it had gone too
deep, and they did not know what to do. At last some one said there was
a man living in a house of ice far in the north who could put out the
fire, so messengers were sent, and after traveling a long distance they
came to the ice house and found the Ice Man at home. He was a little
fellow with long hair hanging down to the ground in two plaits. The
messengers told him their errand and he at once said, &ldquo;O yes, I
can help you,&rdquo; and began to unplait his hair.</p>
<p class="par">When it was once all unbraided he took it up in one hand
and struck it once across the other hand, and the messengers felt the
wind blow against their cheeks. A second time he struck his hair across
his hand, and a light rain began to fall. The third time he struck his
hair across his open hand there was sleet mixed with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>the
rain drops, and when he struck the fourth time great hailstones fell
upon the ground, as if they had come out from the ends of the hair.
&ldquo;Go back now,&rdquo; said the Ice Man, &ldquo;and I shall be
there tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the messengers returned to their people, whom they
found still gathered helplessly about the great burning pit. The next
day while they were all gathered about the fire, there came a wind from
the north, and they were afraid, for they knew that it came from the
Ice Man. But the wind only made the fire blaze higher. The light rain
began to fall, but the drops seemed only to make the fire hotter. Then
the shower turned to a heavy rain, with sleet and hail that killed the
blaze and made clouds of smoke and steam rise from the red coals. The
people fled to their homes for shelter, and the storm rose to a
whirlwind that drove the rain into every burning crevice and piled
great hailstones over the embers, until the fire was dead and even the
smoke ceased. When at last it was all over, and the people returned,
they found a lake where the burning pit had been, and from below the
water came a sound as of embers still crackling.</p>

same song, and feeling sure now that it was real, he went in the
direction of the sound and found that it came from a single green stalk

<h3 class="label">MYTH THIRTY-FIVE.</h3>
<h3 class="main"><i>The Nunnehi and Other Spirit Folks.</i></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Nunnehi or Immortals, the &ldquo;People who
live everywhere,&rdquo; were a race of spirit people who lived in the
highlands of the old Cherokee country and had a great many town-houses,
and especially on the tops of the bald mountains, the high peaks where
no timber grows.</p>
<p class="par">They had large town-houses on Pilot Knob, and in
Nik-Wasi mound, in what is now Macon County, North Carolina, and
another in Blood Mountain, and at the head of Nottely river in Georgia.
They were invisible excepting when they wanted to be seen, and they
looked and spoke just like other Indians. They were very fond of music
and dancing, and hunters in the mountains would often hear the dance
songs and the drum-beating in some invisible town-house, but when they
went toward the sound it would shift about and they would hear it
behind them or away in some other direction, so that they could never
find the place where the dance was.</p>
<p class="par">They were a friendly people, too, and often brought lost
wanderers to their town-houses under the mountains, and cared for them
there until they were rested, and guided them back to their homes.
There was a man who lived in Nottely town who had been with the
Nunnehi, when he was a boy about twelve years old, and this is the
story he tells.</p>
<p class="par">One day, when he was playing near the river, shooting at
a mark with his bow and arrows, until he became tired, and started to
build a fish-trap in the water<span class="corr" id="xd23e7181" title=
"Not in source">.</span> While he was piling up the rocks in two long
walls, a man came and stood on the bank and asked him what he was
doing. The man said, &ldquo;Well, that is pretty hard <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>work, and you ought to come and rest awhile;
come and take a walk up the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The boy said, &ldquo;No&rdquo;; that he was going home
to dinner soon. &ldquo;Come right up to my house,&rdquo; said the
stranger, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll give you a good dinner there, and will
bring you home again in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the boy went with him up the river until they came to
a house, when they went in, and the man&rsquo;s wife and the other
people there were very glad to see him, and gave him a fine dinner, and
were very kind to him.</p>
<p class="par">While they were eating, another boy that the boy knew
very well came in and spoke to him, so that he felt very much at
home.</p>
<p class="par">After dinner he played with the other children, and
slept there that night, and in the morning, after breakfast, the man
got ready to take him home. They went down a path that had a cornfield
on one side and a peach orchard on the other, until they came to
another trail, and the man said, &ldquo;Go along this trail across that
ridge and you will come to the river road that will bring you straight
to your home, and now I&rsquo;ll go back to the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">So the man went back to the house, and the boy went on
along the trail, but when he had gone a little distance he looked back,
and there was no cornfield or orchard or fence or house; nothing but
trees on the mountainside. He thought it rather queer, but somehow he
was not frightened, and went on until he came to the river trail in
sight of his house. There were a great many people standing about
talking, and when they saw him they ran toward him shouting,
&ldquo;Here he is! He is not drowned or killed in the mountains!&rdquo;
They told him that they had been hunting him ever since yesterday noon,
and asked him where he had been. He told them the story of what had
happened, and they said there is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>no house there, and it was
the Nunnehi that had you with them.</p>
<p class="par">Once four Nunnehi women came to dance at Nottely town,
and danced half of the night with the young men there, and nobody knew
that they were Nunnehi, but thought them visitors from another
settlement. About midnight they left to go home, and some men who had
come out from the town-house to cool off watched to see which way they
went. They saw the women go down the trail to the river ford, but just
as they came to the water they disappeared, although it was a plain
trail, with no place where they could hide. Then the watchers knew that
they were Nunnehi. At another time a man was crossing over from Nottely
to Hemptown, in Georgia, and heard a drum and the songs of dancers in
the hills on one side of the trail. He rode to see who could be dancing
in such a place, but when he reached the spot the drum and the songs
were behind him, and he was so frightened that he hurried back to the
trail and rode all the way to Hemptown as hard as he could to tell the
story. He was a truthful man and they believed him.</p>
<p class="par">A long time ago a man got lost in the mountains near the
head of Oconaluftee river, and it was very cold and his friends thought
that he must be frozen to death, but he was taken to a cave by the
Nunnehi and given something to eat, and when the weather was more
pleasant they conducted him to the main trail and sent him on home to
the neighbors in the valley below. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long ago, before the Cherokee were driven from
their homes in 1838, the people on Valley river and Hiwassee heard
voices of invisible spirits calling them from the skies, and warning
them of wars and misfortunes which the future held in store, and
inviting them to come and live with the Nunnehi, the Immortals, in
their homes under the mountains and under the waters. For days the
voice hung in the air, and the people listened until they heard the
voice say, &ldquo;If you would live with us, gather every one in your
town-house and fast there seven days, and no one must raise a shout or
a warwhoop in all that time. Do this and we will come and you shall see
us and we shall take you to live with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">The people were afraid of the evils that were to come,
and they knew that the Immortals of the mountains and of the waters
were happy forever, so they counciled in their town-house and decided
to go with them. Those of Anisgayayitown came all together into their
town-house and prayed and fasted for six days. On the seventh day there
was a sound from the distant mountains, and it came nearer and grew
louder until a roar of thunder was all about the town-house and they
felt the ground shake all around them. Now they were frightened, and
despite the warning some of them screamed out.</p>
<p class="par">The Nunnehi, who had already lifted up the town-house
with its mound to carry it away, were startled by the sound and let a
part of it fall to the ground, where we now see the mound Setsi.</p>
<p class="par">They steadied themselves again and bore the rest of the
town-house, with all the people in it, to the top of <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">Long ago a powerful unknown tribe invaded the
country from the southeast, killing people and destroying settlements
wherever they went. No leader could stand against them, and in a little
while they had wasted all the lower settlements and advanced into the
mountains. The warriors of the old town of Nikwasi, on the head of
Little Tennessee, gathered their wives and their children into the
town-house and kept scouts constantly on the lookout for the presence
of danger.</p>
<p class="par">One morning, just before the break of day, the spies saw
the enemy approaching and at once gave the alarm. The Nikwasi men
seized their arms and rushed out to meet the attack, but after a long,
hard fight they found themselves overpowered and began to retreat, when
suddenly a stranger stood among them and shouted to the chief to call
off his men and he himself would drive the enemy back. From the dress
and the language of the stranger the Nikwasi people thought him a chief
who had come with reinforcements from Overhill settlements in
Tennessee. They fell back along the trail, and as they came near the
town-house they saw a great company of warriors coming out from the
side of the mound as from an open doorway. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span></p>
<p class="par">Then they knew that their friends were the Nunnehi, the
Immortals, although no one had ever heard that they lived under Nikwasi
mound. The Nunnehi poured out by hundreds, armed and painted for the
fight, and the most curious part of it all was that they became
invisible as soon as they were fairly outside of the settlement, so
that although the enemy saw the glancing arrow or the rushing tomahawk,
and felt the stroke, he could not see who sent it.</p>
<p class="par">Before such an invisible foe the invaders had to
retreat, going first south along the ridge to where joins the main
ridge, which separates Tah-kee-os-tee (French Broad) from the
Tuckaseigee, and then turning with it to the northeast. As they
retreated they tried to shield themselves behind rocks and trees, but
the Nunnehi arrows went around them and killed them from the other
side, and they could find no hiding place.</p>

in their despair they sat down and cried out for mercy. The Nunnehi
chief told them that they deserved their punishment for attacking a
peaceful tribe, and he spared their lives and told them to go home and
tell their people. It was the custom of the Indians to spare some to
carry the news of battle and defeat. Then the Nunnehi went back to the
mound, and have been there ever since.</p>
<p class="par">They are there now, for when a strong army of Federal
troops came to surprise a handful of Confederates in the last war, they
saw so many soldiers guarding the town that they were afraid and went

<p class="par first">Long ago, while the people still lived in the old
town of Kanasta, on <span class="corr" id="xd23e7268" title=
"Source: Toh-kee-os-tee">Tah-kee-os-tee</span>, (French Broad) two
strangers, who looked in no way different from the other Cherokee, came
into the settlement one day and made their way into the chief&rsquo;s
house.</p>
<p class="par">After the first greetings were over, the chief asked
them from what town they came, thinking they were from one of the
western settlements, but they said, &ldquo;We are of your people and
our town is close at hand, but you have never seen it. Here you have
wars and sickness, with enemies on every side, and after awhile a
stronger enemy will come and take your country from you. We are always
happy, and we have come to invite you to live with us in our town over
there,&rdquo; and they pointed toward Tsuwatelda (Pilot Knob).
<span class="corr" id="xd23e7273" title=
"Not in source">&ldquo;</span>We do not live forever, and do not always
find game when we go for it, for game belongs to Tsulkalu, who lives in
Tsunegunyi, but we have peace always and do not think of danger. We go
now, but if your people will live with us, let them fast seven days and
we will come then and take them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="par">Then they went away toward the west. The chief called
the people together into the town-house, and they held a council over
the matter and decided at last to go with the strangers. They got all
of their property ready for moving, and then went again into the
town-house and began their fast. They fasted six days and on the
morning of the seventh, before yet the sun was high, they saw a great
company coming along the trail from the west, led by the two men who
had stopped <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>with the chief. They seemed just like Cherokee
from another settlement, and after a friendly meeting they took up a
part of the goods to be carried, and the two parties started back
together for Tsuwatelda.</p>
<p class="par">There was one man visiting at Kanasta, and he went along
with them. When they came to the mountain the two guides led the way
into a cave, which opened out like a great door in the side of the
rock. Inside they found an open country and a town, with houses ranged
in two long rows from east to west. The mountain people lived in the
houses on the south side, and they had made ready the other houses for
the newcomers, but even after the people of Kanasta, with their
children and their belongings, had moved in, there were still a large
number of houses waiting ready for the next who might come. The
mountain people told them that there was another town of a different
people, above them in another mountain, and still farther above, at the
very top, lived the Ani-Hyuntikwalaski (the Thunders).</p>
<p class="par">Now all the people of Kanasta were settled in their new
homes, but the man who had only been visiting with them wanted to go
back to his own friends. Some of the mountain people wanted to prevent
this, but the chief said, &ldquo;No, let him go if he will, and when he
tells his friends they may want to come, too. There is plenty of room
for all.&rdquo; Then he said to the man, &ldquo;Go back and tell your
friends that if they want to come and live with us and always be happy,
there is a place here ready and waiting for them. Others of us live in
Datsunalasgunyi and in the high mountains all around, and if they would
rather go to any of them, it will be all the same. We see you wherever
you go, and are with you in all of your dances, but you cannot see us

Then the chief led the man through the cave to the outside of the
mountain and left him there, but when the man looked back he saw no
cave, but only the solid rock. The people of the Lost Settlement were
never seen again and they are still living in Tauwatelda. Strange
things happen there, so that the Cherokee know that the mountain is
haunted and do not like to go near it. Only a few years ago a party of
hunters camped there, and as they sat around their fire at supper time
they talked of the story and made rough jokes of the people of old
Kanasta. That night they were aroused from sleep by a noise as of
stones thrown at them from among the trees, but when they searched they
could find nobody, and were so frightened that they gathered up their
guns and pouches and left the place.</p>

<p class="par first">On the southern slope of the ridge, along the
trail from Robbinsville to Valley river, in Cherokee County, North
Carolina, are the remains of a number of stone cairns. The piles are
level now, but fifty years ago the stones were still heaped up in
pyramids, to which every Cherokee who passed added a stone. According
to the tradition these piles marked the graves of a number of women and
children of the tribe who were surprised and killed on the spot by a
raiding party of Iroquois shortly before <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb195" href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>the final peace
between the two nations. As soon as the news was brought to the
settlement on Hiwassee and Cheowa, a party was made under
Taletanigiski, &ldquo;Hemp-Carrier,&rdquo; to follow and take vengeance
on the enemy.</p>
<p class="par">Among others of the party was the father of the noted
chief, Tsunulahunski, or Junaluska, who (Junaluska) died in about the
year 1855, who was also the chief and hero of the battle of Horseshoe
Bend. For days they followed the trail of the Iroquois across the Great
Smoky Mountains, thru forests and over rivers, until finally they
tracked them to their very town in the far Seneca country.</p>
<p class="par">On the way they met another war party headed for the
south, and the Cherokee killed them all and took their scalps.</p>
<p class="par">When they came near the Seneca town it was almost night,
and they heard shouts in the town-house, where the women were dancing
over the fresh scalps of the Cherokee. The avengers hid themselves near
the spring, and as the dancers came down to drink, the Cherokee
silently killed one and another until they had counted as many scalps
as had been taken on Cheowa, and still the dancers in the town-house
never thought that enemies were near. Then said the Cherokee leader,
&ldquo;We have covered the scalps of our women and children. Shall we
go home now like cowards, or shall we raise the warwhoop and let the
Seneca know that we are men?&rdquo; &ldquo;Let them come if they
will,&rdquo; said the men, and they raised the scalp yell of the
Cherokees.</p>
<p class="par">At once there was an answering shout from the
town-house, and the dance came to a sudden close. The Seneca swarmed
out with ready gun and hatchet, but the nimble Cherokee were off and
away. There was a hot pursuit in the darkness, but the Cherokee knew
the trails <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>and were light and active runners, and managed
to get away with the loss of only one man. The rest got home safely,
and the people were so well pleased with Hemp-Carrier&rsquo;s bravery
and success that they gave him seven wives. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="par first">The Cherokee language has the continental vowel
sounds a, e, i, and u, but lacks o, which is replaced by a deep a. The
obscure or short u is frequently nasalized, but the nasal sound is
seldom heard at the end of a word. The only labial is m, which occurs
in probably not more than half a dozen words in the Upper and Middle
dialects, and is entirely absent from the Lower dialect, in which w
takes its place. The characteristic l of the Upper and Middle dialects
becomes r in the Lower, but no dialect has both sounds of these
letters, but g and d are medials, approximating the sounds of k and t
respectively. A frequent double consonant is ts, commonly rendered ch
by the old traders.</p>

***** This file should be named 53375-h.htm or 53375-h.zip *****
This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:

Produced by Jeroen Hellingman and the Online Distributed
Proofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net/ for Project
Gutenberg (This file was produced from images generously
made available by The Internet Archive/American Libraries.)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
